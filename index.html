			<h1>Happy Birthday!!!</h1>
			<p>Woah!!! Finally, you are 14! A year closer to death LOL. I think we have been friends for 9 years already. WOW! That's a very long time. Just like you, I was also concerned that our friendship might not be as strong as before. I was scared that we might not chat with each other like before. I also want to tell that I am sorry about changing schools. I also want to go to school together with you and have fun like before. After changing schools, I started to treasure the moments I spend with you even more. Whenever I got left out at my new school, I always think about you and our memories. I sometimes miss you so much and if there are some events at my school, it reminds me of how we used to hang out at TTC events. When I go to Finland, I will need to part with you even longer. We won't be able to meet in real life as we do now, but of course, you can phone me and text me whenever you feel like it. I am always available if you need me. I don't want to make you cry on your birthday so I will stop here LOL. <br>

			<b>PS:</b> I cried while writing this.  </p>
